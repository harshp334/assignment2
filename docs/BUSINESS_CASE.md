Problem Statement & Market Size
Heritage tourism represents a $192B global market growing 15% annually, but travel companies lack accessible, comprehensive UNESCO World Heritage Site data with travel context. Current solutions force manual compilation of site information, costing operators 15-20 hours/week per destination and leading to customer complaints from outdated information.
Addressable Market: $2.8B heritage-focused travel segment within broader $8.2B travel planning tools market.
Why Current APIs Don't Work

UNESCO Official API: Basic listings only, no travel context or commercial licensing
Google Places/Travel APIs: Expensive ($17-32/1K requests), poor heritage coverage, lacks UNESCO metadata
Wikipedia APIs: Free but unreliable, inconsistent formatting, no commercial support
Enterprise Travel APIs: Focus on flights/hotels, minimal heritage context, $50K+ contracts

Missing: Curated itineraries, seasonal accessibility, cultural context, affordable SMB pricing.
Target Users & Revenue Potential
Boutique Tour Operators (12,000 globally): $100-500/month pricing, suffering from manual research costs and customer refunds due to outdated information.
Travel Content Creators (45,000+ influencers): $25-150/month pricing, limited by time-intensive research that constrains content production volume.
Educational Travel Companies (3,500+ companies): $200-1,000/month pricing, facing liability concerns from outdated site information affecting student safety.
Travel Apps/Platforms: $500-5,000/month for integration partnerships, seeking heritage-specific features to differentiate their offerings.
Competitive Analysis
Direct Competitors: Few specialized heritage APIs exist, mostly regional ($200-800/month), outdated technology.
Indirect Competitors:

Amadeus/Sabre: Enterprise-focused, weak heritage coverage
TripAdvisor: Deprecated consumer API, limited B2B
General travel platforms: Basic heritage mentions, no UNESCO specialization

Our Advantage: Only comprehensive UNESCO travel database with SMB pricing, rich cultural context, and travel-ready data vs raw site listings.
