# Usage of AI

## Prompts Given to Claude.AI

1. I want to create a web scraper using beautifulsoup that scrapes the following (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_World_Heritage_Sites). I want it to ask the user for a keyword and then a country. Based on these, the model should offer up to three heritage sites. The user must then select one of these sites and input a number of days. Based on these, the model should create a travel itinerary involving the selected heritage site and the number of days selected, and then export the itinerary to a json file. Do not use any APIs.

2. Scrape this site instead of that one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_by_year_of_inscription.

3. I am getting a lot of "No heritage sites found matching in _____." What's the issue here?

4. Only rely on the by-country page. Don't use sample countries or the main unesco lists page.
